👋 Hi, I'm @Meet2197, Data Steward at PoL EXC, focusing on data management to aid developers and researchers in better understanding data.

💼 During my tenure at UMM Mannheim, I honed my skills in data analysis using Tableau, Python, Django, and R Studio Bioconductor formats. Additionally, I'm proficient in statistical software such as SPSS and SAS, complementing my ability to effectively manage data.

💻 My familiarity with Linux systems, Git for version control, and Key Cloak for user management further strengthens my qualifications for roles in data management and analysis.

🎓 With a background in quality management practices and research work involved in biobanking from an internship at the Central Biobank Regensburg, coupled with extensive data analysis techniques from my master's thesis at the Helmholtz Center Munich, I bring a comprehensive understanding of biobanking to the table.

🤝 My expertise lies in organizing and structuring work efficiently, coordinating between different parties, and implementing seamless workflows, facilitating collaboration within various research groups.

📊 My experience with integrating REST APIs for data transfer tasks showcases my proficiency in data management and analysis.
